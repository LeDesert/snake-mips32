## Introduction

This project is a basic implementation of the Snake game using MIPS32 assembly language. The game is designed to run on a MIPS32 simulator and demonstrates fundamental concepts of assembly programming.

## Features

- Classic Snake gameplay
- Simple and intuitive controls
- Score tracking

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need:

- A MIPS32 simulator (e.g., MARS, SPIM)
- The `snakegood.asm` file

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/LeDesert/snake-mips32.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```sh
    cd snake-mips32
    ```

3. Open the `snakegood.asm` file in your MIPS32 simulator.

## Usage

1. Load the `snakegood.asm` file in the MARS MIPS32 simulator.
2. Open the Tools menu, select "Keyboard and Display MMIO" and select "Bitmap Display".
3. Bitmap Display : set the unit width and height to 16x16 and the display width and height to 256.
4. Assemble the program.
5. Run the program.
6. Use the `z`, `q`, `s`, and `d` keys to control the snake in "Keyboard and Display MMIO" .
